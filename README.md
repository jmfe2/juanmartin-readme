Experienced Data & Analytics Leader with 9+ years driving reporting, business intelligence, and process optimization across global operations.

I turn data into actionable insights through strategic reporting, cross-functional collaboration, and tools like Power BI, SQL, and Python. I’ve built reporting teams from the ground up, standardized KPIs, and delivered dashboards that improve decision-making at scale.

Certified in SAFe Agile, Scrum Master, and Google Project Management, I bring agile leadership and technical acumen to manage data-driven initiatives with adaptability and clarity.

I’m also the host of Laboratorio de Psicología, a podcast where we explore the complexity of the human mind, behavior, and mental health through science-based knowledge and expert experiences.

Let’s connect if you're working on meaningful data challenges, tech transformation, or team-driven analytics.
